2) The analytical orbit derived in this homework have a much longer period, much higher maximum separations/velocities, and they don't decay or spiral in towards M33 in any way.

3) This script treats M31as a point mass. However, it will definitely have higher order multipoles that will be significant because of its shape. The gravitational pull on M33 is going to be reduced by the presence of the multipole moments compared to the point mass, which explains why the simulation doesn't have as high a maximum separation/velocity. M33 is also treated as a point mass, with negligible mass, when again the shape of M33 could drastically alter the path it takes because of multipoles. The satellite galaxy isn't accelerated as much when it gets close to M31 as we assume in the code. Of course, the Milky Way is also missing, and that probably accounts for the slight "closing in" of the orbit and other minor disruptions we see in simulation vs. the analytical code.

4) To include the effects of the Milky Way in the simulation, one could find the coordinates of the milky way in terms of M33's center of mass (get to the same coord frame that we have M33 in) then find the distance between M33 and the MW and repeat the same acceleration calculations but with the mass of the Milky Way's halo, disk, and bulge instead. If you wanted a really good answer, you could also calculate the effect of the Milky Way on M31, effectively forcing you to find the position vector of M31's COM compared to the last time step, and then shift your entire coordinate system to accomodate that movement.
