The iterative calculation of the center of mass is important in this case because the impending collision of Andromeda and the Milky Way means that the centers of mass of each galaxy are moving with respect to each other. The location of each COM is going to cause the other COM to accelerate and changes its velocity. To model the collision, this motion must be accurately described at each time step, as the velocity at any point will determine the velocity in future times. If the position calculated is wrong, then for the next step the velocity will be slightly wrong, which will give an even more wrong position, and even more wrong velocity, and so on. Iterating allows us to update the position and velocity as they collide.
